# SAOHobbyGame
If anyone wants to try out anything with game development and likes SAO. This is it.

This is a project for people that love Sword Art Online and want to experiment a SAO like game, just trying out game developement in Unity. 
I watched Sword Art Online again and just really want to play a game that is alike. There isnt any so therefore i thought lets just do something in Unity with the intend to implement features of SAO. 

Thats it basically. Im just doing it because i have fun to experiment with Unity and im somewhat motivated. Its in Voxel style to keep it simple and my Vision of features is like that:

    - A not tremendously large, but different map for every floor (lets start with one to begin with. :D) 

    - A Town to start in with houses that you can enter and "sleep"(lets just say have a room in) in, a main hall where guilds are made, and tent like structures for the town market with npc that sell stuff 

    - Basic UI everything is possible there ig whatever we want

    - Skills that go from Swordskills to smithing skills or foraging or potioncrafting or yk spying or stuff like that you know

    - Questing: Main Quest is slaying the boss on the current level, there are some quests that are from npcs or like side quests planned and some that are around the floor, some Unique Quests with skills as reward that only a small amount of people can get. Also questlines that are for people in different skilltrees like quests for smiths and quests for potionmaker ...
    
    - Stuff to put on the terrain like structures, camps spots where special loot drops, npcs are and flowers and stuff spawn you get the drill

Everything is obviously not the highest standard and its more like a hobby project.
